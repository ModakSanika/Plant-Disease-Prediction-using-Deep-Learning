# Plant-Disease-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
The Plant Disease Prediction project uses deep learning to identify plant diseases from leaf images, enabling early detection and proactive crop management. Built with TensorFlow and OpenCV, it classifies diseases accurately, supporting farmers in improving yield. Future plans include adding more species and creating a user-friendly interface.
